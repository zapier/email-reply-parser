# Email Reply Parser for Python
A port of GitHub's Email Reply Parser library, by the fine folks at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).

## Summary

Email Reply Parser makes it easy to grab *only* the last reply to an on-going email thread.

Say you'd like to parse out a user's response to your transaction email messages:

```
Yes that is fine, I will email you in the morning.

Email clients handle reply formatting differently, making parsing a pain. [We include tests for many cases](https://github.com/zapier/email-reply-parser/tree/master/test/emails). The parsed email:

```
Yes that is fine, I will email you in the morning.
```
